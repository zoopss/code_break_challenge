The module works by taking a string input from the clipboard and then sending it through a loop.
The loop sorts the characters with even indices into the translated1 string and characters with odd indices into translated2 string.
then the output is generated by concatenating translated2 and translated1 into the translated string and print it.
Additionally using pyperclip's copy function, the outputted encrypted string is copied onto the clipboard.
