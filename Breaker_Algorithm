A sample run of the program is as shown

Enter the message to be encrypted...Hello World!
!lo ledrWolH

As is evident the program has taken all characters inside the string "Hello World!" including spaces and rearranged them into supposedly nonsensical text.

If we look at the indices of the plain text ---
					
					H e l l o   W o r l d  !
					0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

And the corresponding ones in the ciphertext ---
				    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  10 11
					! l o   l e d  r W o l  H
				   11 9 7 5 3 1 10 8 6 4 2  0
				   
It isn't hard to notice that the characters with odd indices have been sent to the head of the string and the ones with odd indices at the tail of the ciphertext.

So, First off we need to figure out the index from where to split the cipher text into two parts - one that had odd indices initially and the other with even indices originally.
Then we need to append each character into a list or tuple or even a string, taking one character from each cipher-half string. Then of course the string has been decrypted
and can be printed on to the screen or copied to the clipboard as the encryptor does.


If you think that you've done it, commit your decryptor with your name either in a comment or in the filename the repository or if you don't use Github, mail it to me at msfjarvis@hmamail.com
