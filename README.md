This repository contains a set of python files which are an encryptor and it's decryptor, which you need to debug.
It uses an open source module called pyperclip by Al Sweigart for using the clipboard plain text as the input for plain text
to be encrypted and for outputting the cipher into the clipboard to be pasted somewhere else.
